### Bugs

* [x] The player disapears after some time colliding with the ground
* [x] Jump is not working
* [x] Fall over floor is failing
* [x] Jumping over solid object
* [x] Fix issues with lateral collisions
* [x] Solved undetected jumps
* [x] When the player jumps goes slower I think
* [x] In some cases, the lateral collision detection also is not noticed properly, sometimes it happens, sometimes no, so I think it's because of the same nature of error.
* [x] Check collisions with moving platforms.
* [x] Check change level issue.
* [x] Check player jumping when standing over a moving platform going down.
* [x] The background keeps moving even when the game is paused.
* [x] The player is not changing facing direction.
* [x] When interacting with the server we are always substracting 3 sec tokens.
* [x] I can go though the door even if it's not fully opened
* [ ] Player is not jumping on platform moving up.
* [ ] Problem when changing from level 1, to level 2, to level 1, to level 2


### Nice to have

* [ ] Map (?)

### Questions

* [x] Can we build a computer like the one in Code Lyoko show?
